# WhoseScreenIsItAnyway

The infamous question we ask ourselves each time!  Well, ask no further!

# theWhat

Whose Screen Is It Anyway is a generic applicaiton that will randomize your team members by name (that you can input yourself) and will give them the esteemed responsibility of sharing their work with the group!


# theWhy

Just a fun way to increase group participation.  Feel free to use if you have trouble getting people to get inolved.  Or if you want to roll the dice! 

# theHow
The applicaiton has two buttons on start.  Click go to roll the dice.  The applicaiton will automatically select a member of your group.  The redo button allows you to go back and select the next member for the next share.  Keep going until everyone has had an opportunity.  The list on the left shows the remaining participants.
